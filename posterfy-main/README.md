## üî≠ **Overview**

Posterfy is an open-source web application that allows users to create visually appealing posters for their favorite music albums. Powered by Spotify‚Äôs free API, Posterfy enables users to search for albums, gather album data, and organize the information into a custom poster using the **HTML Canvas** element.

This project is educational, non-commercial, and fully open to contributions. All rights to the images and data are owned by Spotify and the respective artists.

## üîß **How It Works**

1Ô∏è‚É£ **Search for Album**: Users enter the name of the album they want to create a poster for.

2Ô∏è‚É£ **Select Album**: Posterfy displays search results, and users can select their desired album.

3Ô∏è‚É£ **Data Gathering**: Once the album is selected, Posterfy fetches all the necessary data and images from Spotify‚Äôs API.

4Ô∏è‚É£ **Visual Organization**: The gathered data is then visually organized into a custom layout using the HTML Canvas element.

5Ô∏è‚É£ **Poster Generation**: Finally, a rendered image of the poster is generated, which the user can save or share.
